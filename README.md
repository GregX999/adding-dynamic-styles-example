## Example of creating dynamic styles (classes, keyframes, etc.) in React without using extra plug-ins.

This is the example project that goes with my blog post here: [www.99linesofcode.com/dynamically-adding-css-in-react](http://www.99linesofcode.com/dynamically-adding-css-in-react)

The three main files to look at are:
`/src/index.js`
`/src/styleSheets.js`
`/src/CrazyText.js`

If you clone it, just be sure you have npm installed and run it with: `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
