## Example of creating dynamic styles (classes, keyframes, etc.) in React without using extra plug-ins.

This is the example project that goes with my blog post here: [www.99linesofcode.com](http://www.99linesofcode.com/)

If you clone it, just be sure you have npm installed and run it with: `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
